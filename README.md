BRIEF DESCRIPTION 

According to the review from my lecture changes and improvements were made to the application. The improvements and changes made to the application are as follows: 

All the ingredient quantities can be changed accordingly when the recipe is displayed. 

The user can request that the quantities be reset to their original value. 

The user shall be able to clear all the data to enter a new recipe. 

The application can correctly store the ingredients and steps in an array. 

More classes have been created to make the code as neat as possible and easy to read. 

For each ingredient, the user can enter the number of calories and the food group that ingredient belongs to. 

The software notifies the user when the total calories of a recipe exceed 300.
